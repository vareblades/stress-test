# Network Load Testing Tool

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**
Use ONLY on networks you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized testing is illegal.

📋 **Description**
Network stress testing tool for infrastructure evaluation and resilience testing.

🔧 **Features**
- Multi-threaded packet generation
- Multiple protocol testing (UDP, DNS, TCP, HTTP)
- Real-time statistics with visual interface
- CPU core utilization control
- Local network IP validation

#🚀 **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vareblades/stress-test/tree/main
cd stress-test
pip install rich
python wifi-tester.py
```

#🎯 Usage

1. Run: python crash.py/sudo python crash.py
2. Select CPU cores (1-7)
3. Enter local IP (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
4. Set duration or continuous mode
5. Monitor real-time stats

#🛡️ Safety Features

· Local IP validation only
· CPU core limits
· Educational focus only

#📊 Tests

· Network packet handling
· Router performance under load
· Firewall effectiveness
· Service stability

#⚙️ Technical

· Protocols: UDP, DNS, TCP, HTTP
· Multi-threaded architecture
· Rich console UI
· Python 3.7+, Linux/Termux

#🎯 Legitimate Use Cases

1. Network hardening (your own)
2. Cybersecurity education
3. Authorized security audits
4. Device capability testing
5. Academic research

#❌ Prohibited Uses

· Testing without permission
· External IP targeting
· Service disruption
· Malicious activities

#🔒 Best Practices

1. Schedule during maintenance
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Have rollback plans
4. Monitor continuously
5. Document professionally

#📈 Performance Tips

· Use 2-4 CPU cores
· Test off-peak hours
· Monitor resources
· Start short, increase gradually

#🆘 Troubleshooting

· Permission errors: Use local IPs only
· Low performance: Check system resources
· Import errors: pip install rich
